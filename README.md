RB-UIKit
========

A toy implementation of Apple's UIKit targeting iOS 7 level APIs.

Why
===

Too much free time. More practically, the eventual goal is to build a Mac port of UIKit that allows most low-to-mid complexity projects to be compiled and run with close to zero modification.

State
=====

RB-UIKit is currently very immature, and should not be used in production. The code is provided as-is. Anyone looking for a production quality implementation of UIKit should look to [Chameleon](https://github.com/BigZaphod/Chameleon).
