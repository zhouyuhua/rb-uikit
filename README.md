R.B. Frankenstein UIKit
======================

An immature implementation of Apple's UIKit targeting iOS 7 level APIs.

Why
===

Too much free time. More practically, the eventual goal is to build a Mac port of UIKit that allows most low-to-mid complexity projects to be compiled and run with close to zero modification.

State
=====

The codebase is currently very young, and should not be used in production. Anyone looking for a production quality implementation of UIKit for the Mac should look to [Chameleon](https://github.com/BigZaphod/Chameleon).
